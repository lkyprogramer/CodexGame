# Qwen3.8-27B on one RTX 4090

![Historical stock-vLLM comparison on the RTX 3090](docs/media/demo.gif)

Serving setup for [Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B) on a
single 24 GB consumer GPU with vLLM. 150k token context, OpenAI-compatible
API with key auth, and two ready-made configs depending on what you're doing:

| | [batch/](batch/) | [single-user/](single-user/) |
|---|---|---|
| for | API backends, pipelines, many concurrent requests | one or a few people chatting |
| aggregate, 64 concurrent (128 in / 512 out) | **~1,035 tok/s** steady-state decode, 948 end-to-end (~1,222 / 1,042 with all layers int8) | n/a (8 slots) |
| single-stream (C1) decode rate, realistic prompts | 46 tok/s | MTP: **121** tok/s at default sampling, **120** greedy (`CTX=fast`, 64k; 96 / 102 with `CTX=long`, 150k). DFlash2 (`SPEC=dflash2`): **127** default, **130** greedy |
| reproducing its own context (quoting a document, applying an edit) | 46 tok/s | **381 tok/s** at 25k context — 15.0 tokens per verify step, drafted straight from the prompt (`LOOKUP=1 DFLASH_TOKENS=15`) |
| trick | 16-bit recurrent state + int8 tensor-core GEMMs | DFlash2 block speculation by default (7 drafts in one pass, int4-requantized, vLLM PR #52816 backported), calibrated int4 target head, and split-KV verify attention; optional MTP or lookup drafting from the request context |

<sub>Single-stream numbers re-measured 2026-08-22 on current main with
`bash bench/run_benchmarks.sh single` — `vllm bench serve`, the 8 prompts in
`bench/prompts_real.jsonl`, 1024 output tokens, C1, decode rate taken as
`C / mean TPOT`. Quote them against that harness: a client with a different output
length is not measuring the same thing, and mixing the two is how
[#3](https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090/issues/3) got confusing.</sub>

Both modes share one install — the mode is just which launch script you run.
Speculation wins below ~8 concurrent users on short prompts, plain batching above;
on long independent sessions the crossover is much earlier, because a speculating
request reserves recurrent-state pages the pool has few of — the concurrency
paragraph under "DFlash2 at 240k" has the measurement. The table above is the
historical RTX 3090 result at a 250 W power limit. The current general
single-user default was re-tuned on an RTX 4090 at 450 W to 163.5 output tok/s
greedy; configuration and comparison are below:
[If you are the only user](#if-you-are-the-only-user-do-this).

Prefill is a separate budget from either: ~1,810 tok/s at 1k inputs in batch
mode (~1,210 single-user), ~1,000 tok/s at 100k, so a 100k prompt costs ~100 s
of TTFT ([full matrix](batch/README.md#prefill)). How each number was won:
[docs/optimizations.md](docs/optimizations.md).

## Quick start

Docker (recommended — image build, model download and requantization, then
the server; the API is OpenAI-compatible on port 18020):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090 && cd qwen38-27b-rtx3090
docker compose --profile single up -d      # one or a few users; or --profile batch
```

Vision is enabled in both serving modes. OpenAI-compatible `image_url` content
works without another launch flag; set `VISION=0` in `.env` only for a
text-only deployment that should omit the 0.858 GiB vision tower.

The server listens on `0.0.0.0` and is unauthenticated unless you give it a key.
For anything past your own machine, add one first — everything reads it from
`.env` or `api_key.txt`, and nothing needs it otherwise:

```bash
echo "VLLM_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 24)" > .env
```

Or by hand in a venv (same steps: model download, requantization, vLLM
patches, `verify.sh`) — see [Setup](#setup). Then pick a mode:
[batch/](batch/) for throughput, [single-user/](single-user/) for latency.

### If you are the only user, do this

The command above now starts the fastest general single-user profile:
DFlash2 with seven-token verification, lookup drafting off, vision on, eight
request slots, and about 60k context. On the RTX 4090 at its 450 W limit this
measured 163.5 output tok/s on the eight real greedy prompts, versus 148.0 for
the former MTP default. Prefix caching is the remaining general chat opt-in:

```bash
printf 'PREFIX_CACHE=1\n' >> .env
# For answers that quote their prompt, also add:
# LOOKUP=1
# DFLASH_TOKENS=15
docker compose --profile single up -d
```

or, in the venv install:

```bash
venv/bin/python prepare/fetch_dflash2.py   # once, 1.2 GB (Docker's prepare step does it for you)
PREFIX_CACHE=1 bash single-user/start_qwen.sh
```

DFlash2 proposes seven tokens in one pass instead of chaining four MTP
drafts; `SPEC=mtp` selects the old MTP profile. `LOOKUP=0` is the faster
general-generation default. For a coding or RAG workload that reproduces its
input, `LOOKUP=1 DFLASH_TOKENS=15` lets the target verify 16 tokens per step:
the drafter proposes the seven it was trained for and the remaining positions
come directly from the request context. `PREFIX_CACHE=1` retains both the
attention KV and recurrent state for follow-up turns. Historical one-request
measurements on an RTX 3090 at 250 W:

| decode | MTP | DFlash2 (default) | `+ LOOKUP=1 DFLASH_TOKENS=15` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 real chat prompts | 118 tok/s | 132 | **133** |
| reproducing a 25k-token document | n/a* | 260 | **382** |
| text-only request slots / context | 8 / 64k | 8 / 64k | 4 / 56k |

<sub>\* Drafting from the context requires `SPEC=dflash2 LOOKUP=1`. The two
right columns are one server session, where run-to-run greedy divergence is
±3-5%; reproduce them with
`venv/bin/python bench/labd_bench.py <tag> --ctx 20000`.</sub>

`PREFIX_CACHE=1` is orthogonal to the speculator and lookup settings. In a chat
client, a second turn against the same 25k-token document takes 0.56 s to first
token instead of 22.4 s, with the answers unchanged token for token.

**Read that table by column, not by its last cell.** DFlash2 is the general
upgrade; `LOOKUP=1 DFLASH_TOKENS=15` is for one workload. On chat the longer
verify block is worth 1%, because positions past the drafter's block rarely
match the prompt: over `bench/prompts_real.jsonl`, positions 7-14 account for
**72 of 11,069 accepted tokens (0.65%)**, and @changtimwu measured zero on a
TP=2 box in [#22](https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090/issues/22).
What you pay for that 1% is half the request slots and less context because a
16-token verify block doubles the recurrent-state page every resident request
holds (1.66 GiB against 0.88 by the gotcha-33 fit). Set both knobs when answers
quote documents or apply edits, where they are worth 47%; leave lookup off and
the verify block at seven for chat or agentic clients.

All of it is lossless: speculative decoding samples the same distribution as no
speculation at all, the prefix cache resumes recurrent state rather than
approximating it, and GSM8K reads 96.0-96.5% across the three columns.
`SPEC=dflash2` is a one-user mode either way
(see [concurrency](#dflash2-at-240k-ctxhuge-kvarn-also-combines-with-specdflash2)).
Every other knob: [single-user/](single-user/).

### DFlash2 at 240k: `CTX=huge` (KVarN) also combines with `SPEC=dflash2`

```bash
bash kvarn/install.sh                # applies kvarn-v2-runner.patch as its second stage
SPEC=dflash2 CTX=huge PREFIX_CACHE=1 bash single-user/start_qwen.sh
```

Where `CTX=long` doubles the DFlash2 pool with int8 KV (138k), the KVarN cache
takes the same idea further: 268k tokens of pool at 245760 max-model-len, on the
same pinned budget. No kernel work — the KVarN Triton kernels run unmodified on
the V2 runner; the seven fixes in `kvarn/kvarn-v2-runner.patch` are allocator and
geometry logic (the patch header walks through them, including an upstream vLLM
bug in the mamba align resume path, and a NaN path in the DFlash2 candidate
selector that KVarN noise exposes on verbatim-reproduction content). Two
machines, both RTX 3090 at 250 W, `bench/labd_bench.py --ctx 20000` — the
contributor's WSL2 box and this repo's bare-metal one, which do not agree on
decode rate and do agree on everything else:

| `SPEC=dflash2 CTX=huge PREFIX_CACHE=1` | WSL2 | bare metal |
|---|---|---|
| copy (reproduction) | 130 tok/s, 7.8 tok/step | 164 tok/s, 7.83 tok/step |
| code / edit / quote / summary / qa | 89 / 65 / 44 / 38 / 36 | 109 / 83 / 58 / 51 / 43 |
| all six tasks together | 53 tok/s, 3.0 tok/step | 67 tok/s, 3.15 tok/step |
| verbatim reproduction, 25k document | correct | 1,150 / 1,150 chars |
| KV capacity at 245760 max-model-len | 268,169 tokens | 268,169 tokens |
| GSM8K exact-match (thinking off) | 97.0% (n=200) | 95.2% (n=600), 95.0% (n=200) |
| 100k-deep needle, both turns | correct | — |
| turn 2 over a 100k cached prefix | 4.7 s (vs 169 s cold) | — |

<sub>Context for the GSM8K column: every configuration this repo already ships
reads 95.0-96.5% on the same 200-question harness ([docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md)),
and 95.0% is the batch-mode default. 95.2% at n=600 (±0.9 points) therefore sits
inside the band rather than below it — which is the useful comparison, since this
mode inherits KVarN's lossy 4/2-bit cache and should be judged against the other
lossy configurations rather than against bf16. Repeat runs of the reproduction
check on bare metal are bit-identical (same step count, same 1,150 characters),
which is the property that was missing before `PIECEWISE` — see below.</sub>

One caveat to the "all of it is lossless" paragraph above: the speculation here
is still exact, but this mode inherits KVarN's 4/2-bit KV cache, which is lossy —
the same trade `CTX=huge` already makes (deep-needle retrieval passes at 200k).

**On WSL2, every DFlash2 profile needs UVA pinned memory.** The single-user
launcher now detects WSL2 and defaults `VLLM_WSL2_ENABLE_PIN_MEMORY=1`; an
explicit value still overrides it. The drafter forces vLLM's V2 model runner,
which allocates UVA buffers before weights load, while vLLM otherwise disables
pinned memory under WSL2. Without the setting a direct `vllm serve` invocation
aborts with `RuntimeError: UVA is not available`.
Note the name: `VLLM_WSL_PIN_MEMORY` is **not** a vLLM variable and setting it does
nothing — this README named it for 22 minutes on 2026-08-21 (`589daae`, fixed in
`27f51fa`), so a tree cloned in that window will have it.

One knob this mode used to set for you, and now sets only for MTP:
`cudagraph_mode=PIECEWISE`. Prefix caching and a *captured* (FULL) verify step
did not mix on this path. On WSL2 that showed up as acceptance collapsing to
about one token per step; on bare metal it also **corrupted the output** —
special-token ids leaking into the stream, 1 of 1,176 characters matching the
source instead of all of them. It is the capture rather than the drafter: eager
is clean, `LOOKUP=0` is not, forcing a fixed verify-block length is not, and
PIECEWISE — which keeps the compiled graphs and leaves only the multi-query
verify uncaptured — restored both the speed and the correctness on both machines.

`dflash2` has its FULL graphs back (`a75ee4b` fixed the residue, `b356e31` then
swept **all 128** residues under FULL with 0 broken), so at HEAD
`SPEC=dflash2 CTX=huge PREFIX_CACHE=1` runs captured. `SPEC=mtp CTX=huge`
still forces PIECEWISE, and that one is a correctness constraint rather than a
preference: under FULL it breaks at one prompt length in 128 and nobody has
fixed it. Either way prefix caching stays on, which is what the mode is for —
turn 2 over a cached 100k document costs 4.7 s against 169 s cold.

`CUDAGRAPH_MODE=FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` overrides the MTP line for anyone hunting
the root cause. Treat that as unsafe rather than merely slower.

What that trade costs, re-measured at HEAD. The numbers this README used to carry here
had `FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` at 38 tok/s (1.97 per step) on the 25k copy task against
PIECEWISE's 132, and called it 3.5x. That was not the capture mode — it was the residue
bug, which `a75ee4b` fixed. With the same server and only the capture toggled
(`bench/labd_bench.py --ctx 20000`, `SPEC=dflash2 CTX=huge PREFIX_CACHE=1`, decode tok/s):

| | copy | code | edit | quote | summary | qa | all six |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FULL (the default now) | 167.1 | 111.1 | 84.7 | 55.0 | 47.8 | 43.4 | 65.7 (3.03/step) |
| PIECEWISE | 166.3 | 111.3 | 83.0 | 62.4 | 48.6 | 43.1 | 67.6 (3.18/step) |

They are the same. Five of the six are within 2%; `quote` differs by 13% in PIECEWISE's
favour, which is greedy divergence on the task that diverges most, and it is what puts
PIECEWISE 3% ahead overall. So at this context length the capture mode is not a
performance decision at all, in either direction.

Short prompts are where a difference was measured, and that measurement is older:
78/125/202 tok/s captured against 74/102/176 piecewise on de/en/code, i.e. **13-18%**.
Treat that as an upper bound — @mjungnickel18 measures 0.2-2.3% for the same comparison
when only runs with identical step counts are compared, and he is right that greedy runs
which take a different number of steps are not comparable. Past 8k the two are within
noise on bare metal (111.8 vs 109.3 tok/s at 8k, 78.2 vs 86.1 at 16k, 68.9 vs 73.3 at
32k, 58.4 vs 56.0 at 50k, unique prompts, one server per mode). Under GPU passthrough on
a VM the same comparison costs 2-3x, reported in
[#13](https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090/pull/13) and consistent with the
uncaptured verify being launch-bound: launches that are nearly free here are not free
there.

Two limits worth knowing before you point this at anything: what it does with
more than one user, and what the long verify block costs.

**It is a one-stream mode, and the limit is the pool rather than `MAX_SEQS`.** An
earlier version of this paragraph said the knob was the seat count and that
`MAX_SEQS=8` lifts it. It does not, and @mjungnickel18 was right to push back in
[#25](https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090/issues/25). A *resident* request
reserves 1+k = 8 recurrent-state slots — **15.8% of the 69,758-token `CTX=fast` pool**,
~0.82 GiB of its pinned 5.20, which is the 0.88 GiB [gotcha 33](docs/gotchas.md) fitted
from the memory model — before it holds one token of context. Seven fit with 128-token
prompts, five with 4k-token ones and two with 16k ones. MTP's k=4 costs 0.44 GiB, so
eight fit, four of them at 16k. Past that the extras queue, and once the pool is full
something has to be preempted and recomputed to make room — a ramp of tiny requests
hits that at the seventh. `MAX_SEQS` decides how many requests are *admitted*, not how
many can run. The pool itself is **unchanged** by the setting (268,169 tokens at
`CTX=huge` either way, ~8 MiB total between 1 slot and 8 —
[gotcha 33](docs/gotchas.md)), which is the part of the old paragraph that was right.

What concurrency actually costs, measured with `bench/conc_ladder.py` on distinct
4k-token prompts — each salted so nothing is served out of the prefix cache — 256-token
answers, `MAX_SEQS=8`, `CTX=fast`, 250 W:

| streams | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **dflash2** per-stream decode tok/s | 137 | 97 | 46 | 33 |
| **dflash2** aggregate decode tok/s | 137 | 225 | 309 | *5 resident, no steady state* |
| **dflash2** ms per forward pass | 25.9 | 32.8 | 49.1 | — |
| **mtp** per-stream decode tok/s | 126 | 103 | 46 | 23 |
| **mtp** aggregate decode tok/s | 124 | 212 | 280 | **383** |
| **mtp** ms per forward pass | 24.8 | 29.8 | 43.1 | 62.3 |

Two things to read off it. The verify step *does* batch — aggregate throughput keeps
climbing for both speculators, and no preemption happens at any of these points — so
"the block verify does not batch" is not what is going on. What it costs is latency:
each additional resident request adds about 7 ms to every forward pass under DFlash2
(5 ms under MTP), so the second user roughly halves your tokens per second and the
fourth roughly quarters them. That 7 ms is not attention over their context — with
128-token prompts the slope is the same (25.2 → 45.8 ms from one resident to four) —
it is the per-request recurrent state, the same thing that limits residency. And MTP keeps scaling to 8 streams where DFlash2 runs
out of pool at 5, which is the whole of its C8 advantage. Point one person at DFlash2;
point a team at `SPEC=mtp` or batch mode.

**On `CTX=huge`, raising `MAX_SEQS` is worse than not raising it.** That profile
defaults to 2 seats, and the reason is the same state page against a smaller pinned pool
(4.90 GiB): five residents with a short prompt, four with a 16k one. Force it
to 8 and feed it eight independent 16k-token streams and the scheduler starts evicting
— **10 preemptions** in one run, peak occupancy 99.4%, per-stream 3 / 7 / 72 tok/s,
end-to-end aggregate down to 10.3 from 13.0 at a single stream. The same eight streams
against the shipped 2 seats: **0 preemptions and 14.4 tok/s**, i.e. 40% more work done
by admitting fewer requests. An earlier version of this README recommended exactly that
override. Leave the seats where they are.

Make the streams long and independent and it stops being about decode at all. Eight
16k-token prompts with nothing shared between them: end-to-end aggregate **15.8 tok/s**
against 131 for a single stream, mean TTFT 71.7 s, two requests resident — but the
decode-only aggregate over the same run is 183 tok/s, tokens per step is unchanged at
3.71 and nothing is preempted. The run is 131k tokens of prompt at ~1,600 tok/s and
2,048 tokens of answer, so it is a prefill measurement wearing a decode measurement's
units, and `SPEC=mtp` reads the same 15.0-15.9 there. If your clients each bring their
own long document, that is the number you get, and no speculator changes it.

What *does* change it is sharing the document. The same eight 16k streams with one
shared prefix and `PREFIX_CACHE=1` (`bench/conc_ladder.py --shared`):

| streams | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| end-to-end aggregate tok/s | 15.5 | 128.4 | **147.8** | 68.3 |
| mean TTFT | 14.6 s | 1.3 s | 2.6 s | 11.5 s |

One stream pays the prefill; everyone after it hits the cache, and four concurrent
readers of the same document get 148 tok/s end-to-end against 15.9 when the documents
differ. That is the shape of workload this mode is for — a chat client or a coding
front-end against one codebase — and it is nearly a 10x difference from the same server
on the same prompt length.

`DFLASH_TOKENS=15` doubles the state page to 1.66 GiB: three residents with an empty
context, **two** with 4k-token prompts, against five. That mode is single-user in the
literal sense, and its launcher default of `MAX_SEQS=4` is already the tighter number —
do not raise it. `DFLASH_TOKENS=15 MAX_SEQS=8` used to boot, answer `/health` and then
die on the first concurrent batch (`torch.OutOfMemoryError` in the engine, every request
500); the launcher now caps the captured-graph size so that configuration degrades to
piecewise instead ([gotcha 38](docs/gotchas.md)). It does boot at 240k since `82bd62d`,
which caps `max_model_len` to 221,184 above 7 drafts rather than letting the server fail
to come up.


The capture mode is fixed at boot, and for `SPEC=mtp CTX=huge` the trade is not
optional. What FULL does there is corrupt one prompt length in every 128, and only
for a request that hits the prefix cache. The broken residue is a function of the
draft count (`R = 117 + k`, the same for both speculators), which is why scoping
the workaround to `dflash2` was wrong the first time — `SPEC=mtp CTX=huge` shipped
with the same bug at residue 4. Piecewise costs MTP nothing measurable
(87.8/86.1/70.4/63.5 tok/s captured against 93.5/83.8/70.3/59.6 piecewise over
8k-50k), so it keeps PIECEWISE until residue 4 comes back verbatim under a full
sweep.

**Do not test that residue by its symptom.** The location is deterministic and the
damage is not: the same `mtp` residue has returned an empty answer, a one-character
answer, and 400 tokens of fluent Danish inventing a task the prompt never asked for
(2 of 1,146 characters matching the document). A detector keyed on "it repeats" or
"it came back empty" passes at least one of those. Gotcha 37 in
[docs/gotchas.md](docs/gotchas.md) has the residue table; `bench/residue_sweep.py`
sweeps all 128 residues and judges every answer on how much of the document came
back, and `bench/verbatim.py` self-tests that rule against all three shapes.

### More than one GPU

Everything here is written for one 24 GB card, and that is the only configuration
measured in this README. It is not the only one that works: `--tensor-parallel-size`
goes through untouched, via `EXTRA_ARGS`.

```bash
EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 2" bash single-user/start_qwen.sh
```

Reported working on **2x RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB** by
[@antonybudianto](https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090/issues/22) — two cards
that could not hold this model individually. I have one 3090, so every multi-GPU
number in the issues is a user report rather than something I have reproduced, and
the tuning here (the pinned `KV_MEM`, the graph budget, `MAX_SEQS`) is sized for a
single card and is probably not right for yours. If you run it on two, numbers in
[#7](https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090/issues/7) are welcome.

## Benchmarks

Full tables per mode in [batch/README.md](batch/README.md) and
[single-user/README.md](single-user/README.md); quality in
[docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md). Reproduce any of it with
`bash bench/run_benchmarks.sh batch|single` against your own server.

### vs. ninfer-3090

[ninfer-3090](https://github.com/Don-Chad/ninfer-3090) is a standalone C++/CUDA engine
that publishes cohort benchmarks for this model on this card. Theirs are 1,024-token
answers from 29-34-token prompts, greedy, MTP3, int8 KV, prefix reuse off, an
8,192-token context window, and **thinking on** at `reasoning_effort=medium`, so their
1,024 tokens include reasoning. Ours are 8 realistic chat prompts (English, Danish,
code), 1,024-token answers, model-default sampling, thinking off:

| Cohort | ninfer-3090 (MTP3) | this repo, batch | single-user, MTP | single-user, DFlash2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | 71.00 tok/s | 45.5 | 111.1 | **121.8** |
| C2 | 90.66 tok/s | 86.3 | 191.8 | **195.5** |
| C4 | 100.28 tok/s | 168.3 | 268.5 | **278.9** |
| C8 | 165.33 tok/s | 324.9 | **407.3** | 389.9 |
| C64 (128 in / 512 out) | not supported | **~1,035** | — | — |

Decode rate, C × 1000 / mean TPOT. All four of our columns were re-measured together
on the current stack with `bench/run_benchmarks.sh`, keeping the second run after each
restart as the script advises; greedy instead of default sampling reads
131.2 / 214.6 / 285.7 / 405.5 for DFlash2. Run-to-run spread on the same server is
5-8%, so treat one-decimal differences between the three right-hand columns as noise —
C1 and C8 are where the modes genuinely separate.

Theirs is the **decode** column of their table; their end-to-end column reads
70.19 / 89.43 / 97.89 / 161.28, and an earlier version of this table quoted *those*
against our decode rate, which was not like-for-like. What still is not like-for-like,
in their favour and ours: their C1 is a single prompt in a single run with no error
bars, thinking is on for them and off for us, and they publish no power limit or driver
version — ours is an RTX 3090 pinned at 250 W. Peak VRAM is comparable (23.0 vs
22.1 GiB at C8). The gap is mostly vLLM's continuous batching plus the memory this
repo's requantization frees up.

### Quality

The whole stack is quantized, so the honest question is what it costs. Short
version: **IFBench 78.3** prompt-level strict vs 79.5 for the unquantized model
(one point), **perplexity 8.09** on 33k held-out tokens, **GSM8K 96.5%** (200
questions, greedy). Speculative decoding — MTP, DFlash2 and the lookup drafter —
is exact by construction and changes none of it; the int8-activation steps in
batch mode are the only knobs that trade accuracy for speed, and they cost
0.9-3.7% perplexity depending on how far you push them. Per-configuration
tables: [docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md).

### Why this isn't just `vllm serve`

Nine things, from requantizing both embedding matrices to drafting straight out
of the prompt — one line each, then the reasoning and measurements, in
[docs/optimizations.md](docs/optimizations.md).

### What each step buys

Measured cumulatively on the 3090, 64 concurrent, 128 in / 512 out, `vllm bench
serve` random dataset:

| step | what it does | e2e output tok/s | steady-state decode |
|---|---|---|---|
| W4A16 AutoRound body (as published) + fp8 KV | int4 Marlin kernels, 66.7k-token pool | 370 (48 conc, 256/256) | — |
| + lm_head / embed_tokens int8 | 2.6 GB of cache pages back | 516 | ~585 (37 requests resident) |
| + fp16 recurrent state | 64 requests resident, half the state traffic | 707 | ~830 |
| + int8 activations, MLP (default) | int8 tensor cores on 74% of the FLOPs | 942 | ~1,094 |
| + int8 activations, everything (`INT8_LAYERS=.`, needs `GPU_UTIL=0.95`) | | 1,042 | ~1,222 |

And single-stream on realistic prompts (single-user mode, T = model default /
greedy):

| step | tok/s | tokens per step | draft acceptance, position 0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| no speculation | 46 / 46 | 1.0 | — |
| MTP-2 as shipped (bf16 drafter, full head, fp32 state) | 66 / 79 | 2.1 / 2.4 | 65% / 80% |
| MTP-4, int8 drafter, 40k draft head, fp16 state | 78 / 99 | 2.2 / 2.7 | 58% / 70% |
| + probabilistic draft sampling (`CTX=fast`, k=4) | 90 / 98 | 2.6 / 2.7 | 69% / 70% |
| same with 3 drafts on FlashInfer/fp8 KV (`CTX=long`, 150k) | 84 / 89 | 2.5 / 2.4 | 69% / 71% |
| + sampler patch, split-KV verify attention | 93 / 99 | 2.6 / 2.6 | 69% / 70% |
| + draft vocab counted over the model's own outputs | 107 / 109 | 2.9 / 2.9 | 74% / 74% |
| + GPTQ-int4 lm_head (calibrated) | 109 / 112 | 2.8 / 2.8 | 73% / 73% |
| + GPTQ-int4 MTP module (**fast variant, shipped**) | **~114 / 118-124** | 2.8 / 2.9-3.0 | 74% / 77% |
| DFlash2 block drafter instead of MTP (`SPEC=dflash2`, int4-requantized) | **118 / 126** | 3.14 / 3.34 | ~75% / ~78% |
| + drafting from the context (`LOOKUP=1`, reproduction opt-in) | **130** at C1, up to **259** where the model reproduces its context | 3.3-7.8 | |
| + a 16-token verify block the context fills (`LOOKUP=1 DFLASH_TOKENS=15`) | **133** at C1, up to **381** reproducing context | 3.4-15.0 | |

(Steps 4-6 are the same 8-prompt protocol; greedy is deterministic for a
given server and request order but differs between configs and even with
prefix-cache hits, so single runs carry ±3-5% on tokens/step —
`bench/run_benchmarks.sh single` reproduces 111.1 / 120.0 tok/s decode at C1,
the best repeats read 119 / 124.)
Going deeper (k=5) loses again: 106 / 105. k=4 is the knee, but on vLLM
0.27.1's FlashInfer backend (needed for fp8 KV, i.e. for 150k context) four
drafts crash the engine with an illegal memory access as soon as one request
finishes while another is mid-generation — club-3090 reports the same "n=4
eventually dies, n=3 stable" pattern — so `CTX=long` drafts 3 and gives up
~7%; `CTX=fast` (FlashAttention, bf16 KV, ~64k context, the default) keeps k=4
and is also the only backend the split-KV attention patch applies to.

Two things that did *not* help, measured rather than assumed: fine-tuning the
MTP head on the model's own outputs (KL halves, greedy top-1 on response
tokens unchanged; `drafter/README.md`), and retuning Marlin's tile
configuration for M ≤ 16 on sm86 (3-7% per GEMM in isolation,
nothing measurable end to end — the remaining gap to peak bandwidth is the
memory system's ramp on 16-92 MB reads, not the kernel).

## Setup

You need: a 24 GB Ampere or newer NVIDIA card, a recent driver, Python 3.12,
~40 GB disk. Everything below is CPU-safe to run while the GPU does other
things. (Or skip the venv and use the container: [docs/docker.md](docs/docker.md).)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syv-ai/qwen38-27b-rtx3090 ~/qwen-serving
cd ~/qwen-serving

python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install vllm huggingface_hub hf_transfer ninja

# model, ~19.5 GB
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 venv/bin/hf download \
  dbirks/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound \
  --local-dir models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound

# requantize lm_head + embeddings + the MTP draft module (CPU only, a few minutes)
venv/bin/python prepare/quant_lm_head.py models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound
venv/bin/python prepare/quant_embed.py   models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound
venv/bin/python prepare/quant_mtp.py     models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound
# 40k-token draft head for single-user mode (uses the shipped id list)
venv/bin/python prepare/build_draft_vocab.py models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound \
  --ids prepare/draft_vocab_ids.json
# single-user "fast" variant (~1 GB from the Hub, hardlinks the rest): int4-GPTQ
# lm_head + drafter; single-user/start_qwen.sh picks it up automatically
venv/bin/python prepare/fetch_fast_variant.py
# optional: the W4A16 DFlash2 block drafter (1.2 GB) for SPEC=dflash2 single-user mode
venv/bin/python prepare/fetch_dflash2.py

# patch vllm (all written against 0.27.1; reapply after upgrades)
for p in patches/*.patch; do
  patch -p1 -d venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/vllm < $p
done
# optional: the KVarN 4/2-bit KV cache for 262k context (docs/long-context.md)
bash kvarn/install.sh

# api key — optional, but the server binds 0.0.0.0 and is open without one
openssl rand -hex 24 > api_key.txt
```

Then `bash verify.sh --no-server` — it checks the venv and vLLM version, that
every patch in `patches/` is actually applied, and that the model has been
requantized (lm_head, embeddings, MTP module, draft head). Then pick a mode
and follow its README:

- **[batch/](batch/)** — throughput. `bash batch/start_qwen.sh`
- **[single-user/](single-user/)** — latency. `bash single-user/start_qwen.sh`

First start takes a few minutes (torch.compile, CUDA graph capture, flashinfer
JIT). Test it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:18020/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat api_key.txt 2>/dev/null)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "qwen3.8-27b",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hej"}],
       "chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}}'
```

Qwen recommends temperature 0.7 / top_p 0.8 for instruct mode, and 1.0 / 0.95
with thinking enabled (the default).

Both launchers include token usage and per-request generation metrics in API
responses. Streamed responses carry them on the final usage chunk even when
the client omits `"stream_options": {"include_usage": true}`.

Tool calling works over the same endpoint — send `tools` with `tool_choice:
"auto"` and the reply carries `tool_calls`. Both launchers set
`--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser qwen3_coder`; the parser has to
read Qwen's XML call format, which is what this model's chat template emits —
not the JSON that `hermes` reads. `TOOLS=0` turns it off.

To check the numbers on your own card: `bash verify.sh` (also probes the live
server and prints which attention backend and KV pool it came up with), then
`bash bench/run_benchmarks.sh batch` or `... single` reproduces the tables
above against the running server (`--prefill` and `--long` add the prefill
matrix and the long-context rows), `bash bench/real_rep.sh <tag> 3 0` repeats
the single-stream row, and `python bench/quality_battery.py <tag>` the
perplexity / GSM8K rows. For the concurrency rows,
`python bench/conc_ladder.py --n 1,2,4,8 --ctx-tokens 4096`; for the prompt-length
bug, `python bench/residue_sweep.py <tag>` (all 128 residues) with
`python bench/verbatim.py` as its offline self-test.
